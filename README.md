# tech-docs

This repository houses a personal portfolio of technical writing. The goal is to keep a curated collection of document examples that demonstrate style and breadth of experience.

## tech-writer-portfolio

All sample documents live in the `tech-writer-portfolio` directory. Each numbered folder represents a particular documentation category and currently contains placeholders for future content:

1. **01-internal-communications** – memos, newsletters, and other internal messaging.
2. **02-operational-instructions** – step-by-step instructions or runbooks.
3. **03-production-optimizations** – tips or guides to improve processes or tooling.
4. **04-api-documentation** – API references, usage examples, and integration docs.
5. **05-knowledge-base-articles** – short Q&A or troubleshooting articles.
6. **06-process-documentation** – process flows and standard operating procedures.
7. **07-reference-guides** – quick reference material and cheat sheets.
8. **08-style-guides** – editorial standards and style guidance.
9. **assets** – images and other media that support the documentation.

Each folder contains a `.gitkeep` file so the directories remain in version control while empty. As writing samples are added, those placeholders will be replaced with real content.
