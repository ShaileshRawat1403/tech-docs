<details><summary><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></summary>

| Issue                            | Resolution                                                             |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Folder appears empty             | Look for `.gitkeep` placeholders — content is still in progress       |
| Markdown not rendering properly  | Open files using GitHub preview or a Markdown-aware editor like VS Code |
| Broken internal links            | Use correct relative paths and file name cases                        |
| Visuals not displaying           | Check `assets/diagrams/` or `assets/visuals/` folders                 |
| Style inconsistencies            | Refer to `08-style-guides/markdown-style-guide.md`                    |
