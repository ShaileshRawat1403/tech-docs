# CLI Tool Documentation

> Learn how to install, configure, and use the CLI tool effectively across environments.

---

## Quick Overview (TL;DR)

```bash
curl -sSL https://yourcli.dev/install.sh | bash
yourcli init
yourcli diagnose
yourcli deploy --project your-project-name
```

- Configuration file: `~/.yourcli/config.yaml`
- Need help? Run: `yourcli --help`

---

## Install the CLI Tool

Install the CLI globally using the following command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://yourcli.dev/install.sh | bash
```

You can verify installation:

```bash
yourcli --version
```

**Expected output:**

```bash
yourcli version 1.2.3
```

> ðŸ’¡ Ensure the binary is added to your `$PATH`. Confirm with:

```bash
which yourcli
```

---

## Initialize a Project

To set up a new CLI workspace, run:

```bash
yourcli init
```

This generates the following structure:

```
your-project/
â”œâ”€â”€ .yourcli/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

> ðŸ’¡ Edit the `config.yaml` file to customize project-level settings.

To open the config file quickly:

```bash
vim ~/.yourcli/config.yaml
```

---

## Run Diagnostics

To verify configuration and system readiness:

```bash
yourcli diagnose
```

**Expected output:**

```bash
âœ” CLI installation: OK
âœ” Configuration file: Found
âœ” Environment: Compatible
```

> ðŸ’¡ Use `--verbose` for a full log of the check:

```bash
yourcli diagnose --verbose
```

---

## Deploy the Project

To deploy your project to a remote environment:

```bash
yourcli deploy --project your-project-name --env production
```

**Expected output:**

```bash
âœ” Connecting to server...
âœ” Validating build...
âœ” Deploying to production...
âœ” Deployment successful!
```

For testing:

```bash
yourcli deploy --dry-run
```

This simulates deployment without pushing changes.

---

## Update or Uninstall

To update the CLI:

```bash
yourcli update
```

To uninstall:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.yourcli
```

And optionally:

```bash
rm /usr/local/bin/yourcli
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem                        | Solution                                             |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `command not found: yourcli`  | Ensure CLI binary is added to `$PATH`.              |
| Config file missing           | Run `yourcli init` or manually create config.yaml.  |
| Permission denied             | Try `chmod +x` on the binary or use `sudo`.         |
| Deployment failed             | Add `--verbose` to see error details.               |
