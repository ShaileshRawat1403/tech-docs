# CLI Tool Documentation

## Overview
This document explains how to use the command-line interface that accompanies the product. It summarizes available options, provides examples, and offers troubleshooting tips for common errors encountered by new users.

## Audience
The guide is for developers and system administrators who prefer working in a terminal or need to automate tasks through scripts. Basic knowledge of shell syntax and environment variables is assumed.

## Objective
Help users become productive with the CLI by documenting essential commands and showing how they fit into development or deployment workflows. The instructions focus on cross-platform compatibility and standard conventions.

## Usage Scenarios

2. Run `command --help` to list global options and available subcommands.
3. Configure authentication and environment variables as needed.
4. Execute basic commands to create, read, update, and delete resources.
5. Integrate the CLI with your build scripts or automated workflows.
6. Review the troubleshooting section if you encounter permission errors or other issues.
