# Overview

This explainer outlines the end-to-end stages of a standard machine learning (ML) pipeline—from data collection to deployment and monitoring. It breaks down each component, explains how they interact, and provides best practices for building reproducible, scalable workflows.

Designed for data engineers, ML practitioners, and technical stakeholders, this guide promotes shared understanding, accountability, and alignment across teams.

## Why It Matters

A well-defined ML pipeline improves:

- **Collaboration** between data scientists, engineers, product teams, and compliance leads  
- **Reproducibility** of experiments and model training  
- **Auditability** for regulators or internal reviewers  
- **Automation** opportunities to reduce manual effort and reduce time-to-production  
- **Monitoring** and visibility into model drift, errors, or performance issues  

Without a clear pipeline structure, ML systems often suffer from ad-hoc workflows, undocumented steps, and fragile integrations—leading to avoidable failures in production.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing or evaluating an ML pipeline, ensure:

- Access to all data sources and collection logic  
- Defined use case and model objectives  
- Tooling for version control and CI/CD  
- Agreement on success metrics and deployment environment  
- Stakeholder map covering data, infra, legal, and business teams

## Tasks

Use the following stages as a repeatable structure when designing or reviewing ML pipelines:

### ✅ 1. Data Collection

- [ ] Identify and document internal/external data sources  
- [ ] Assess data availability, format, and access frequency  
- [ ] Include metadata, consent flags, and collection timestamps  
- [ ] Log data lineage and version  

### ✅ 2. Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

- [ ] Normalize, transform, or impute missing values  
- [ ] Encode categorical variables and scale numeric fields  
- [ ] Handle outliers and anomalies  
- [ ] Version all preprocessing steps (e.g., using DVC, MLflow)  

### ✅ 3. Model Training

- [ ] Select baseline algorithms and architectures  
- [ ] Define hyperparameter ranges and search strategy  
- [ ] Implement reproducible training scripts  
- [ ] Use training/validation/test splits or cross-validation  

### ✅ 4. Evaluation

- [ ] Define and track relevant metrics (e.g., F1, RMSE, AUC)  
- [ ] Compare models across time periods or segments  
- [ ] Conduct fairness and sensitivity analysis  
- [ ] Include stakeholder reviews where applicable  

### ✅ 5. Deployment

- [ ] Package model for deployment (e.g., Docker, ONNX, TorchScript)  
- [ ] Define rollback strategy and release thresholds  
- [ ] Set up A/B testing or shadow deployments  
- [ ] Expose model via API, batch job, or internal tooling  

### ✅ 6. Monitoring and Maintenance

- [ ] Monitor prediction accuracy and data drift in real-time  
- [ ] Track latency, throughput, and resource consumption  
- [ ] Log user feedback and error cases  
- [ ] Schedule retraining or model refresh based on thresholds

## ❌ vs ✅ Examples

| Pipeline Area           | ❌ Don’t Do This                                           | ✅ Do This Instead                                          |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data preprocessing      | Apply transformations manually and undocumented            | Use pipelines and version control to track preprocessing    |
| Model versioning        | Overwrite trained model files without labels               | Use semantic naming, tagging, and registries                |
| Evaluation              | Choose metrics post hoc to match results                   | Define evaluation metrics up front                          |
| Deployment              | Push directly to production with no fallback               | Use CI/CD with rollback and canary deployment capabilities  |
| Monitoring              | Only check logs when failure occurs                        | Set up proactive monitoring with alerts and thresholds      |

## Tips

- Use notebooks only for exploration—production code should be in versioned scripts  
- Validate pipeline components independently before full runs  
- Treat pipeline creation as a collaborative artifact, not a solo task  
- Share visual diagrams of the pipeline with business stakeholders  
- Include communication checkpoints in handoffs between teams

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                            | Possible Cause                              | Suggested Fix                                            |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Model performs well offline but fails live | Training data is stale or not production-like | Align test data to match live inputs; re-validate splits |
| Features missing during inference | Pipeline discrepancy between train/test      | Use the same pipeline artifacts across stages            |
| Retraining fails or overwrites logs | No version control on model or logs         | Use MLflow, DVC, or Git-integrated tools                 |
