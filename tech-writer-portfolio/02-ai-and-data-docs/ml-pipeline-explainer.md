# ML Pipeline Explainer

## Overview
This document outlines the stages of a typical machine learning pipeline, from data collection to model deployment. It breaks down each phase—such as preprocessing, training, evaluation, and monitoring—and highlights best practices to maintain reproducibility and accountability.

## Audience
Data engineers and machine learning practitioners who want to understand how different components interact. The explainer is also useful for technical stakeholders seeking a high-level overview of the process.

## Objective
Clarify the end-to-end workflow of machine learning projects. By detailing each step, the document helps teams align on responsibilities and identify where automation can reduce manual effort.

## Usage Scenarios
Use this explainer when designing new pipelines or reviewing existing ones. It can help pinpoint bottlenecks or areas where additional tooling might increase efficiency.

## Best Practices
Ensure that data preprocessing steps are versioned and logged. Employ continuous integration to run unit tests on pipeline components. Establish metrics to track model performance after deployment.

## Action Steps
1. Outline the data sources and collection strategy.
2. Document preprocessing operations and transformation logic.
3. Describe model training methods, including hyperparameter tuning.
4. Specify evaluation metrics and validation procedures.
5. Detail the deployment process and mechanisms for rollback.
6. Plan for ongoing monitoring and periodic retraining based on new data.
