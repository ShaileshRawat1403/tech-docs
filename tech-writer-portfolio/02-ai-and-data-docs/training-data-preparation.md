# Overview

Training data is the foundation of any machine learning system. The quality, diversity, and structure of your dataset directly impact model performance, bias, and generalizability. This guide outlines best practices for preparing training data across industries and use cases.

---

## Why It Matters

Poor data leads to poor models. Incomplete, skewed, or noisy datasets result in:

- Biased predictions or exclusions  
- Overfitting to irrelevant patterns  
- Poor generalization on unseen data  
- Costly retraining and validation cycles  

#### Well-prepared training data improves:

- Model accuracy and robustness  
- Fairness and inclusivity across groups  
- Faster training and fewer post-deployment issues  
- Alignment with business or ethical goals

## Prerequisites

- A clearly defined machine learning task (e.g., classification, summarization, entity extraction)  
- Annotated or raw datasets sourced from relevant systems, documents, or user logs  
- Versioning tools (e.g., DVC, Git LFS) or cloud storage  
- Input from SMEs, domain reviewers, and impacted stakeholders

## Tasks

### ✅ Define the Labeling Schema

- [ ] What is being predicted or generated?  
      _e.g.,_ `Billing`, `Technical Issue`, `Feedback`, `Feature Request`
- [ ] Are labels mutually exclusive and clearly defined?  
      _e.g.,_ Avoid overlaps like `Hate Speech` vs `Offensive Language`
- [ ] Are gold standards or annotated samples available?  
      _e.g.,_ 10–15 validated samples per class, agreed upon by SMEs
- [ ] Has the taxonomy been reviewed by stakeholders?  
      _e.g.,_ HR/legal review for label categories like `Payroll`, `Harassment`

### ✅ Source & Curate Raw Data

- [ ] Are data sources recent, relevant, and authorized?  
      _e.g.,_ Zendesk tickets from Q1 2025 + Slack exports
- [ ] Is sensitive info removed or masked?  
      _e.g.,_ Replace with `<USER_ID>`, `<EMAIL>`, `<ACCOUNT_NO>`
- [ ] Are rare cases and underrepresented classes included?  
      _e.g.,_ Fraud logs showing logins from unusual locations
- [ ] Is multi-format data stored consistently?  
      _e.g.,_ All entries as `{id, type, source, label, timestamp}`

---

### ✅ Clean & Normalize

- [ ] Remove duplicates or low-signal entries  
      _e.g.,_ Identical tweets or copy-pasted responses
- [ ] Standardize formatting (units, date, punctuation)  
      _e.g.,_ Use ISO 8601 for dates; lowercase all text
- [ ] Filter out NSFW, spam, or harmful data  
      _e.g.,_ Use regex or classifier to exclude offensive terms
- [ ] Normalize multilingual or mixed-language data  
      _e.g.,_ Translate or tokenize “Hola, cancel my plan” as unified input

### ✅ Annotate & Review

- [ ] Are annotators trained with clear guides?  
      _e.g.,_ 5-page PDF with category examples + edge cases
- [ ] Is agreement tracked (e.g., Fleiss' kappa)?  
      _e.g.,_ Categories under 70% agreement flagged for rework
- [ ] Are borderline cases flagged?  
      _e.g.,_ Use `flag_for_review` in annotation UI
- [ ] Are tools accessible and exportable?  
      _e.g.,_ Label Studio with export as JSON + audit logs

---

### ✅ Track Metadata

- [ ] Is metadata structured and complete?  
      _e.g.,_ `{ "source": "email", "lang": "en", "annotated_by": "user_42" }`
- [ ] Is sampling logic transparent?  
      _e.g.,_ “Sampled 1K tickets ≥50 words, balanced by month”
- [ ] Are transformations documented?  
      _e.g.,_ “Removed stop words + anonymized account info”

## Tips

- Start small with a pilot dataset before scaling annotation  
- Use active learning to prioritize ambiguous or high-impact samples  
- Augment real data with synthetic examples cautiously (bias amplification risk)  
- Maintain changelogs and version control on datasets  
- Embed fairness checks and spot auditing into data curation cycles

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                                | Likely Cause                            | Suggested Fix                                  |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Model struggles with minority classes| Underrepresented categories in training | Oversample, synthesize, or re-label rare cases |
| Label disagreement among annotators  | Vague instructions or unclear taxonomy  | Revise schema and run calibration sessions     |
| Model memorizes instead of generalizes | Duplicates or data leakage             | De-duplicate and split by user/time/topic      |
| Legal/ethical review flags usage     | PII or unlicensed data in corpus        | Remove/redact or source from public datasets   |
