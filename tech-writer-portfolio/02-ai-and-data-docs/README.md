# AI and Data Documentation

> Helping people understand the systems they rely on—but don't always see.

---

## Overview

This directory offers modular documentation for working with AI systems, data pipelines, and prompt-based interactions. It serves beginners, communicators, and advanced users seeking clarity and precision when documenting AI behavior or data-dependent systems.

You’ll find both theoretical guidance and practical templates—each rooted in real-world scenarios and usability best practices.

---

## Why It Matters

AI and data systems are often misunderstood due to their complexity, rapid evolution, and lack of human-centered documentation. Poorly written instructions can cause serious downstream effects—especially when decisions rely on misunderstood logic or misinterpreted model behavior.

This documentation aims to bridge that gap by:

- Demystifying AI interfaces, models, and prompt behavior
- Offering clear, structured, and tested templates for technical and non-technical users
- Supporting teams in communicating AI capabilities, limitations, and intended use

---

## Prerequisites

To benefit from this documentation, users should ideally:

- Be familiar with basic markdown and GitHub workflows
- Have general understanding of AI or machine learning terminology (for some files)
- Be involved in writing, reviewing, or managing AI-related content or product workflows

---

## Tasks

- [x] Explore key guides like [Understanding AI Models](understanding-ai-models.md) and [Prompt Dissection Lab](prompt-dissection-lab/README.md)
- [x] Use templates for retrospectives and audits under `prompt-dissection-lab/`
- [x] Learn how to improve communication through [Deep Structures](deep-structures/01-foundations-of-deep-structures.md)
- [x] Contribute by submitting PRs or opening issues with questions or improvements

## Tips

- Start with the `README.md` inside each subfolder to understand its focus
- Use the Prompt Dissection Lab to debug and refine your prompt strategy
- Refer to real-world prompt failure scenarios to guide team retrospectives

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                                           | Suggested Action                                 |
|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Can't follow a prompt dissection example       | Start from the Clarity Track subfolder first     |
| Unsure how to structure your own AI guide      | Use the included templates under `prompt-dissection-lab` |
| Need help understanding AI model terms         | Check [Understanding AI Models](understanding-ai-models.md) |
| Confused between tracks (clarity vs literary)  | See the breakdown in the [Framework README](prompt-dissection-lab/prompt-pause-proceed/README.md) |
