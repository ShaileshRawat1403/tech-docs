# Prompt Framework Guide

## Overview
This guide introduces best practices for creating effective prompts when working with large language models. It explains key concepts behind prompt engineering, such as role specification, context inclusion, and iterative refinement. By following these guidelines, teams can improve the relevance and accuracy of AI-generated responses.

## Audience
Data scientists, machine learning engineers, and technical writers who need to design prompts for AI-driven applications. Some familiarity with natural language processing concepts is helpful but not required.

## Objective
Provide actionable guidance on structuring prompts that yield consistent results. The document covers common pitfalls and illustrates how to evaluate output for quality and bias.

## Usage Scenarios
Use this guide when developing chatbots, content generation tools, or any application that relies on large language models. The principles also apply to automated testing frameworks where prompt consistency is critical.

## Best Practices
Define the desired role or persona for the AI clearly in the prompt. Include relevant context without overwhelming the model. Experiment with format variations and temperature settings to achieve predictable behavior.

## Action Steps
1. Identify the goal of the conversation or text generation task.
2. Craft a concise prompt that sets expectations for style and tone.
3. Provide necessary background information in a structured manner.
4. Test different wording to see how it affects the response.
5. Evaluate results for clarity, completeness, and absence of bias.
6. Document successful prompt formats for future reference.
