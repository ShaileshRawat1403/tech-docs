# AI and Data Documentation 

> Help teams document, explain, and communicate AI and data systems with clarity, consistency, and shared responsibility.

---

## Overview

This guide introduces the documentation practices needed to support AI models, data pipelines, and machine learning systems. It is designed for both technical teams and cross-functional partners—such as internal communications, legal, and product teams—who rely on clear, trustworthy explanations of how systems work and evolve.

---

## Why It Matters

AI and data systems are powerful—but without documentation, they become opaque and risky. Well-structured documentation helps:

- **Communications teams** explain decisions and system behavior clearly  
- **Stakeholders** evaluate risks, outcomes, and ethical implications  
- **Technical teams** align across tools, models, and datasets  
- **Compliance teams** maintain audit-ready, transparent records  

This documentation isn’t just about code. It’s about building understanding, context, and accountability.

---

## Prerequisites

Make sure your team has:

- A shared understanding of what your AI and data systems do  
- Identified documentation owners (technical and communication leads)  
- A centralized platform for storing and accessing docs (e.g., GitBook, Confluence, internal Git repo)  
- Clear review loops between data science, product, legal, and comms  

---

## Tasks

- [ ] Identify documentation scope: model purpose, data inputs, outputs, risks, assumptions  
- [ ] Choose templates that work for both technical and non-technical audiences  
- [ ] Include communication checkpoints: when should the comms team be informed or involved?  
- [ ] Ensure every major update (e.g., model retrain, policy shift) is documented with rationale and impact  
- [ ] Provide plain-language summaries alongside technical details  

---

## Tips

- Use layered content: keep summaries at the top and link to deep tech detail for those who need it  
- Add glossaries to avoid misunderstanding key terms (e.g., “drift,” “bias,” “inference”)  
- Communicate intent and limitations of models—not just their architecture  
- Use diagrams for system flows, decision trees, or approval checkpoints  
- Create “stakeholder views” that show how AI impacts users, customers, or internal workflows

## Troubleshooting

| Problem                                         | Recommendation                                                   |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Communication team unclear about model impact  | Add plain-language summaries and stakeholder sections to docs    |
| Legal/compliance not looped in early           | Include a comms/legal review step in the documentation workflow  |
| Docs live in technical silos                   | Maintain a shared doc hub with tagged, audience-specific views   |
| Stakeholders unaware of recent changes         | Add doc update triggers to release notes or newsletter cycles    |
