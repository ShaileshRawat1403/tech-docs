# Overview

Versioning is critical to maintaining integrity and clarity in the lifecycle of AI models. This document explains how to version models across development, testing, and deployment stages. It includes strategies for naming, logging, and communicating changes, especially in high-risk or customer-facing environments.

## Why It Matters

Without proper version control, teams risk:

- Deploying the wrong model or outdated weights  
- Inconsistent performance tracking across experiments  
- Miscommunication between engineering, product, and compliance teams  
- Inability to audit or roll back changes during incidents  

Strong versioning ensures:

- Reproducibility across environments  
- Alignment across cross-functional teams  
- Confidence in performance comparisons and A/B tests  
- Readiness for external audits or internal reviews

## Prerequisites

- A model registry or centralized tracking system (e.g., MLflow, Weights & Biases, Hugging Face Hub)  
- Clear boundaries between experiment, staging, and production models  
- Model artifact storage (e.g., S3, Git LFS, on-prem vaults)  
- Awareness of team-level or regulatory compliance expectations

## Tasks

### ✅ Set a Versioning Scheme

- [ ] Use semantic versioning (e.g., `v1.3.0`) or task-specific tags (`gpt4-cx-v2.1`)  
- [ ] Align versioning with code, data, and prompt versions  
- [ ] Use changelogs to document improvements, fixes, and caveats

### ✅ Track Metadata per Version

- [ ] Training data snapshots and preprocessing steps  
- [ ] Model architecture and hyperparameters  
- [ ] Prompt template used (if applicable)  
- [ ] Evaluation metrics by dataset slice (accuracy, F1, toxicity, etc.)  
- [ ] Intended use cases and known limitations  
- [ ] Approval or review status (legal, compliance, etc.)  

### ✅ Integrate with CI/CD Pipelines

- [ ] Automate version tags during model packaging or deployment  
- [ ] Push versions to registries with metadata and README  
- [ ] Run checks for version mismatch across model + prompt + dataset  
- [ ] Enable rollback to previous versions if KPIs dip  

### ✅ Communicate Across Teams

- [ ] Share release notes with product, legal, comms, and support teams  
- [ ] Flag versions intended for external-facing use (e.g., user queries, chatbot UI)  
- [ ] Include model version in product telemetry or UI logs  
- [ ] Align dashboards and metrics to track version-level insights

## Tips

- Use hashes (e.g., SHA256) to uniquely identify model binaries  
- Store prompts and config files alongside model weights  
- Avoid hardcoding version numbers into code—use dynamic loading  
- Don’t treat model versioning as only a dev task—it’s cross-functional

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                              | Likely Cause                                | Suggested Fix                                  |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Conflicting results from same model  | Data or prompt changed but version not bumped | Update version and log change clearly         |
| Hard to trace a model bug            | No linked changelog or metadata snapshot     | Introduce versioning discipline via templates |
| Team uses different model variants   | No central registry or poorly tagged files   | Use unified registry with search/filter       |
