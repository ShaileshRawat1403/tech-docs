# PDF Conversion Pipeline

## Overview
This document describes an example continuous integration pipeline that converts Markdown documentation into PDF files. It highlights the necessary dependencies, configuration steps, and recommended tools for achieving consistent output during automated builds.

## Audience
DevOps engineers and technical writers who maintain documentation in source control and want to publish PDF versions as part of a CI/CD workflow.

## Objective
Provide a step-by-step guide for setting up a PDF conversion process. The pipeline ensures that documentation is generated automatically whenever changes are merged, reducing manual effort and ensuring up-to-date PDFs.

## Usage Scenarios
Use this pipeline when distributing offline versions of docs or when integrating with release deliverables. It is valuable for teams that require formal or secure documentation packages for customers.

## Best Practices
Cache dependencies in the CI environment to speed up builds. Validate Markdown syntax before conversion to catch errors early. Store generated PDFs as build artifacts for easy retrieval.

## Action Steps
1. Choose a conversion tool such as Pandoc or an equivalent.
2. Set up the CI environment with required packages and fonts.
3. Add a build step that runs the conversion script for each Markdown file.
4. Save output PDFs as artifacts or upload them to cloud storage.
5. Monitor build logs for warnings or errors.
6. Schedule periodic reviews to confirm the PDFs meet quality standards.
