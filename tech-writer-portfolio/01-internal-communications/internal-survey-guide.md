# Internal Survey Guide

Use this guide to create and run effective internal surveys that gather actionable insights. Well-designed surveys help measure sentiment, test ideas, and guide internal initiatives with clarity and confidence.

---

## Overview

Internal surveys are a structured way to understand employee needs, reactions, and ideas. They support transparent decision-making, improve communication, and align organizational actions with employee input.

---

## Why It Matters

Surveys play a vital role in:

- Surfacing hidden challenges and opportunities  
- Measuring the effectiveness of internal programs  
- Testing new ideas or policies before rollout  
- Reinforcing employee voice and organizational trust  

When designed and closed effectively, surveys become tools for cultural alignment and operational improvement.

## Prerequisites

Before launching a survey, ensure you:

- Have a clear objective or hypothesis  
- Know your target audience (e.g., department, company-wide)  
- Decide on survey timing (align with initiatives or cycles)  
- Choose a tool suited to your data needs (e.g., anonymity, export formats)

## Tasks

### 1. Define Your Objective

Write a focused goal for the survey. Example:  
*“Understand employee awareness of the hybrid work policy and identify gaps in communication.”*

### 2. Choose the Right Tool

Common platforms include:

| Tool             | Use Case                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Google Forms     | Quick surveys, easy analytics              |
| Microsoft Forms  | Integrated with Office 365 ecosystem       |
| Typeform         | Visual, conversational experience          |
| Qualtrics        | Advanced analytics and segmentation        |

### 3. Design the Survey

Use a balanced mix of question types:

- **Multiple choice** for quantitative summaries  
- **Rating scales** (e.g., 1–5) for sentiment trends  
- **Open-ended** questions for qualitative insights  

Avoid: leading, biased, or double-barreled questions.

### 4. Pilot Test Internally

Share the survey with a small group to review:

- Clarity of wording  
- Logical flow and length  
- Any friction or confusion  

Incorporate feedback before full rollout.

### 5. Distribute Thoughtfully

- Use familiar channels (email, Slack, newsletter)  
- Set a clear deadline  
- Clarify anonymity and privacy expectations  
- Pin or resurface periodically to boost completion

### 6. Analyze Results

#### Quantitative:

- Use built-in graphs or export to Excel  
- Identify patterns, low scores, or correlations  

#### Qualitative:

- Tag responses by theme or tone  
- Highlight recurring phrases or suggestions  

### 7. Close the Feedback Loop

Share a summary back with the team:

- Acknowledge participation  
- Highlight key insights  
- Outline specific next steps  
- Set expectations for future updates or changes

## Tips

- Keep it under 10 minutes  
- Use consistent rating scales across questions  
- Randomize options to reduce order bias  
- Include a “Prefer not to say” option where appropriate  
- Avoid jargon or internal acronyms

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                         | Recommendation                                    |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Low response rate            | Use personal reminders or manager nudges         |
| Confusing responses           | Simplify question wording and re-test             |
| Incomplete submissions        | Reduce total length or adjust question order      |
| Limited insights              | Include at least one open-ended question          |
