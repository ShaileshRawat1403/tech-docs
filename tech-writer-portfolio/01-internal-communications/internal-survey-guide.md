# Internal Survey Guide

Use this guide to create and run effective internal surveys that gather actionable insights. Well-designed surveys help measure sentiment, test ideas, and guide internal initiatives with clarity and confidence.

## Why Internal Surveys Matter

Internal surveys help organizations:

- Understand employee sentiment and pain points  
- Identify improvement areas across communication, tools, or policies  
- Test the effectiveness of initiatives (e.g., onboarding, hybrid policy)  
- Increase transparency by giving employees a voice  

A thoughtful survey process builds trust and improves decision quality.

## Survey Lifecycle Overview

1. **Define Your Objective**  
   Be specific—what do you want to know, and why?

2. **Choose the Right Tool**  
   Examples: Google Forms, Microsoft Forms, Typeform, Qualtrics  

3. **Design the Survey**  
   Use a mix of:
   - Multiple-choice (for easy metrics)
   - Rating scales (for sentiment tracking)
   - Open-ended (for qualitative depth)  

4. **Pilot Test It**  
   Share a draft with 3–5 internal users. Check for:
   - Confusing wording  
   - Survey fatigue  
   - Logical flow  

5. **Distribute Thoughtfully**  
   - Use internal channels (email, Slack, newsletter)  
   - Clarify response deadline and anonymity status  

6. **Analyze Results**  
   - Quantitative (graphs, tables)  
   - Qualitative (themes, sentiment tags)  

7. **Close the Loop**  
   Share key findings and next steps with participants.

## Best Practices

- Keep it under 10 minutes  
- Avoid leading or double-barreled questions  
- Randomize option order (if needed)  
- Offer a “prefer not to say” option for sensitive topics  
- Use consistent scales (e.g., 1–5) across questions
