# Stakeholder Engagement Guide

> Align internal initiatives with transparency and trust through deliberate stakeholder communication.

---

## Overview

This guide outlines how to proactively identify and engage stakeholders during any internal project or organizational change. Consistent engagement builds confidence, reduces friction, and fosters shared ownership.

---

## Why It Matters

Internal initiatives succeed when the right people are informed, involved, and aligned. Engaging stakeholders:

- Surfaces blind spots early  
- Improves adoption of new processes or tools  
- Builds organizational momentum through shared visibility  
- Reduces delays due to misalignment or resistance  

---

## Prerequisites

Before launching stakeholder outreach:

- Finalize project scope and initial timeline  
- Identify internal dependencies across departments  
- Secure leadership support for communication timelines  
- Choose where updates will be documented (e.g., Confluence, Slack, Asana)

---

## Tasks

### Identify Stakeholders

Include people who:

- Are directly impacted by the change  
- Can influence project success or adoption  
- Provide operational, legal, or technical input  
- Will help cascade communication (e.g., team leads)

Common stakeholder groups:

- Department heads  
- Project sponsors  
- IT, HR, Legal  
- Support teams and frontline users  
- Executive leadership

### Group by Engagement Tier

| Tier   | Stakeholder Example         | Frequency        | Format                      |
|--------|-----------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------|
| Tier 1 | Executives, project sponsors| Weekly/live      | Calls, emails, briefings    |
| Tier 2 | Department leads, PMs       | Biweekly         | Slack, email, dashboards    |
| Tier 3 | End-users, support staff    | As needed        | Training, walkthroughs, docs|

This helps tailor messaging by importance and frequency.

### Build a Stakeholder Communication Plan

Use the template below:

```
üìå Stakeholder: [Name or Group]  
üìç Role: [e.g., HR Partner, Legal Reviewer]  
üìÖ Frequency: [Weekly / Monthly / Milestone-based]  
üì® Format: [Slack / Email / Meeting / Docs]  
üìù Notes: [Key concerns, influence level, involvement required]  
```

Maintain this in a shared doc or project space.
