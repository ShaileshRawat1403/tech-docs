## Communication Plan Template

Use this framework to build your stakeholder communication strategy:

```
📌 Stakeholder: [Name or Group]
📍 Role: [e.g., Finance Lead, HR Partner]
📅 Frequency: [Weekly / Monthly / Milestone-based]
📨 Format: [Slack / Email / Meeting / Docs]

```

📎 Tip: Maintain this list in a shared doc for transparency across teams.

## Tools to Use

| Tool            | Purpose                                  |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|

## Best Practices

✅ Do:
- Communicate early—even before project launch
- Use consistent formats and update intervals
- Share impact, not just status

❌ Don’t:
- Assume silence = agreement
- Rely on a single medium (e.g., only email)
- Skip updates during setbacks
