# Feedback Loop Mechanisms

This guide outlines how to implement effective internal feedback loops that foster continuous improvement, trust, and employee engagement.

## Why Feedback Loops Matter

Establishing clear mechanisms for listening and responding to employees helps:

- Identify and resolve internal friction early  
- Improve processes through real-world insights  
- Strengthen psychological safety and transparency  
- Build a culture of accountability and participation

## Common Feedback Channels

| Channel               | Format             | Use Case                                     |
|-----------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Pulse Surveys         | Anonymous, periodic| Morale, sentiment, initiative feedback       |
| Open Office Hours     | Live sessions      | Q&A, directional feedback with leaders       |
| Internal Forms        | Asynchronous       | Project or initiative-level suggestions      |
| 1:1 Check-ins         | Manager-led        | Personalized input and issues                |

## Implementing a Feedback Loop

1. **Capture**  
   Choose the right channel for the context. Ensure anonymity if needed.

2. **Analyze**  
   Use a centralized tool (e.g., Notion, Trello, Excel) to categorize feedback.

3. **Act**  
   Assign owners and deadlines for items requiring action or communication.

4. **Close the Loop**  
   Respond publicly (in all-hands, newsletters, Slack) with updates or decisions.

## Tools You Can Use

| Tool          | Purpose                   |
|---------------|----------------------------|
| Typeform      | Anonymous submissions      |
| Google Forms  | Custom form with logic     |
| Slack Threads | Fast, transparent input    |
| Notion Board  | Feedback triage and updates|
| Trello        | Assigning follow-up owners |

## Best Practices

- Schedule quarterly feedback reviews  
- Avoid overpromising—focus on what can be acted on  
- Include feedback status dashboards (e.g., “Reviewed,” “In Progress,” “Resolved”)  
- Highlight changes that came directly from employee input

Subject: What You Said — What We’re Doing

Hi Team,

Thanks to everyone who submitted feedback this cycle. Here’s what we heard:

• More clarity on project roles
• Better documentation for onboarding
• Frustration with redundant tools

Actions:

✓ Role clarity guide is in progress

We’ll keep listening.
