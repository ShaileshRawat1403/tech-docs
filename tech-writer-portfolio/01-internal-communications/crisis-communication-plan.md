## Overview

This document outlines a crisis communication plan for internal teams to follow during major disruptions, including outages, HR incidents, or high-impact operational failures. It ensures a calm, structured, and factual approach to internal messaging.

---

## Why It Matters

Clear and timely internal communication during a crisis is essential for:
- Reducing confusion and speculation
- Maintaining employee trust and morale
- Ensuring consistent messaging across departments
- Supporting rapid resolution and accountability

---

## Prerequisites

Before a crisis occurs:
- Assign clear communication roles (Crisis Lead, HR, IT, etc.)
- Establish communication channels (Slack, Email, Confluence)
- Prepare message templates and escalation paths
- Create a crisis-response Confluence hub or folder

---

## Tasks

### Identify Triggers for Use

Activate this plan when:
- A system-wide outage or data breach occurs
- Leadership changes unexpectedly
- Emergency policy enforcement is needed
- A public-facing incident affects internal teams

---

### Define Communication Objectives

1. Provide factual, timely updates
2. Reinforce confidence through clarity and consistency
3. Limit misinformation and internal speculation
4. Align stakeholders on next steps and responsibilities

### Assign Roles and Responsibilities

| Role                   | Responsibility                                      |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Crisis Lead            | Coordinates messaging, owns communication timeline |
| HR/Legal Advisor       | Ensures compliance and tone alignment              |
| Team Managers          | Cascade updates, answer questions                  |
| Support/IT Lead        | Provide root cause, ETA, and technical context     |

---

### Use a Consistent Messaging Format

#### Messaging Template:

```
[Short Headline: Whatâ€™s the issue]

**What Happened:**  
Fact-based description of the incident.

**What Weâ€™re Doing:**  
Actions taken, teams involved, initial resolution timeline.

**What You Should Do:**  
Instructions or reassurances for employees.

**Whatâ€™s Next:**  
Expected time of next update or resolution status.
```

#### Example:

```
ðŸ›‘ Outage: Internal Tools Unavailable

**What Happened:**  
Our HRMS and Timesheet tools are down due to a network issue.

**What Weâ€™re Doing:**  
IT is working to restore access. ETA: 2 hours.

**What You Should Do:**  
Do not log work manually. Updates will follow.

**Whatâ€™s Next:**  
Next update at 12:00 PM. Contact: #it-support or helpdesk@company.com

### Choose the Right Communication Channels

| Channel         | Purpose                                       |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Slack / Teams   | Fast updates and real-time coordination       |
| Email           | Formal organization-wide communication        |
| Confluence      | Crisis hub for storing updates and documents  |
| Town Halls      | For live Q&A or leadership involvement         |

---

## Tips

- Keep paragraphs short; use bullet points for clarity
- Timestamp every update clearly
- Assign a single POC per message or campaign
- Update at regular intervals, even if there is no progress
- Archive all messages post-crisis for compliance and learning

## Troubleshooting

| Problem                    | Solution                                               |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Mixed messages from teams | Use pre-assigned Crisis Lead to centralize updates     |
| Info overload             | Stick to 4-part message format; avoid long paragraphs  |
| Miscommunication persists | Reiterate updates via multiple channels                |
