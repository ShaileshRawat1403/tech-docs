# Crisis Communication Plan: Internal Response during Disruption

A clear and practical internal response plan to manage organizational communication effectively during crises.

---

## Overview

This **Crisis Communication Plan** provides a structured framework for internal teams to manage messaging during major disruptions. It covers various crisis scenarios, including system outages, HR-related incidents, or high-impact operational failures. By following this plan, you ensure a calm, structured, and factual approach to internal communications, fostering trust and enabling rapid resolution.

---

## Why It Matters

Transparent and timely internal communication during a crisis is paramount for maintaining business continuity and employee confidence. An effective crisis communication plan helps your organization:

* **Reduce Confusion and Speculation:** Provide clear, factual updates to prevent rumors and anxiety among employees.
* **Maintain Employee Trust and Morale:** Demonstrate leadership's control over the situation and commitment to employee well-being.
* **Ensure Consistent Messaging:** Deliver a unified voice across all departments, avoiding contradictory or fragmented information.
* **Support Rapid Resolution and Accountability:** Streamline information flow to empower response teams and provide critical updates to decision-makers.

By implementing this plan, you build resilience and reinforce that the organization can navigate challenging situations with structure and clarity, which is a key indicator of enterprise maturity.

## Audience and Scope

This document is intended for:

* **Crisis Leads and Incident Commanders:** To guide overall communication strategy and execution.
* **Internal Communications Teams:** As the primary operational guide for drafting and disseminating messages.
* **HR and Legal Advisors:** To ensure all communications comply with policy and legal requirements.
* **Team Managers and Department Heads:** To cascade information accurately to their teams and answer localized questions.
* **Support and IT Leads:** To provide technical context, status updates, and estimated times of resolution.

The scope of this plan is limited to **internal communication during active crisis events**. It outlines procedures for internal announcements, updates, and feedback loops. It **does not cover external (public-facing) crisis communications** or detailed technical incident response procedures, though it integrates closely with them.

---

## Prerequisites

Before a crisis occurs, ensure your organization has established the following:

* **Assigned Communication Roles:** Clearly define who fills the Crisis Lead, HR/Legal Advisor, Team Manager, and Support/IT Lead roles within the crisis communication structure.
* **Established Communication Channels:** Confirm and test your primary and secondary internal communication channels (e.g., dedicated Slack/Teams channels, company-wide email lists, Confluence crisis hub).
* **Prepared Message Templates:** Pre-draft basic templates for initial notifications, updates, and resolution announcements to accelerate response time.
* **Defined Escalation Paths:** Understand the process for escalating information and decisions to senior leadership.
* **Crisis Response Hub:** Create a dedicated Confluence space or folder to store all crisis-related documentation, timelines, updates, and templates for easy access.

## Instructions

Follow these steps to activate and execute the internal crisis communication plan.

### 1. Identify Crisis Triggers and Activate Plan

Activate this plan immediately when any of the following triggers occur, or when directed by the Crisis Lead:

1.  **System-Wide Outage:** A critical application or infrastructure service becomes unavailable or severely degraded.
2.  **Data Breach or Security Incident:** Any unauthorized access, exposure, or loss of sensitive company or customer data.
3.  **Unexpected Leadership Change:** Abrupt departure or transition of key executive personnel.
4.  **Emergency Policy Enforcement:** Immediate implementation of new or revised policies due to unforeseen circumstances.
5.  **Public-Facing Incident:** Any external event (e.g., negative media coverage, public product failure) that impacts internal teams or operations.
6.  **Major HR Incident:** Significant internal events affecting employee safety, well-being, or compliance.

### 2. Define Communication Objectives

Once activated, confirm the immediate objectives for internal messaging:

1.  **Provide Factual, Timely Updates:** Deliver accurate information as quickly as it becomes available.
2.  **Reinforce Confidence:** Maintain employee trust through clarity, transparency, and consistency in messaging.
3.  **Limit Misinformation:** Proactively address rumors and internal speculation with verified facts.
4.  **Align Stakeholders:** Ensure all relevant parties (leadership, teams, individuals) understand their roles and next steps.

### 3. Assign Roles and Responsibilities

During a crisis, clearly assign and confirm the following roles to ensure a coordinated communication effort:

| Role                   | Responsibility                                                                    |
| :--------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Crisis Lead** | Coordinates overall messaging strategy, owns the communication timeline, and approves all internal communications. |
| **HR/Legal Advisor** | Ensures all communications comply with company policy and legal requirements, advises on sensitive topics, and reviews tone. |
| **Team Managers** | Cascade updates to their direct reports, answer localized questions, and collect team sentiment. |
| **Support/IT Lead** | Provides technical context, root cause analysis (when available), estimated time of resolution (ETA), and progress updates to the Crisis Lead. |
| **Communications Writer** | Drafts clear, concise, and structured messages for various channels based on input from leads. |

### 4. Use a Consistent Messaging Format

Always use the following standardized message format to ensure clarity and conciseness in all internal crisis communications:

#### Standard Messaging Template:

```markdown
[**CRITICAL UPDATE / STATUS UPDATE / RESOLVED**: Short, Clear Headline Summarizing the Issue]

**What Happened:**
[Fact-based, concise description of the incident. Avoid speculation. State what is known.]

**What Weâ€™re Doing:**
[Outline immediate actions being taken, teams involved in resolution, and initial resolution timeline or next steps for the incident response team.]

**What You Should Do:**
[Clear, actionable instructions or necessary reassurances for employees. This might include "no action required," "avoid using X system," or "refer to Y for updates."]

**Whatâ€™s Next:**
[Expected time of the next update, specific channels to monitor for further information, or the status of full resolution.]
````

#### Example of a Crisis Message:

```markdown
ðŸ›‘ **OUTAGE: Internal HRMS and Timesheet Tools Unavailable**

**What Happened:**
At 10:15 AM IST, our HR Management System (HRMS) and Timesheet tools became unavailable due to a network connectivity issue affecting our primary data center.

**What Weâ€™re Doing:**
Our IT Infrastructure team is actively investigating the root cause and working to restore network access. We have engaged our network provider for expedited support. We anticipate initial restoration efforts will take approximately 2 hours.

**What You Should Do:**
Please do not attempt to log work or access HRMS manually at this time. Your managers will provide guidance on alternative work tracking if the issue persists beyond the estimated resolution.

**Whatâ€™s Next:**
We will provide the next update at 12:30 PM IST via email and the #it-outages Slack channel. For immediate questions, please monitor #it-support.
```

### 5\. Choose the Right Communication Channels

Select the most appropriate channel based on the urgency, audience, and formality required for each update:

| Channel                  | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| :----------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Slack / Microsoft Teams (Dedicated Channel)** | **Primary for rapid, real-time coordination** among crisis response teams and quick dissemination of high-level updates to broad employee groups. Create a specific, temporary crisis channel.                                                                     |
| **Email (Company-Wide Distribution Lists)** | **For formal, organization-wide announcements** and critical updates where a permanent record is necessary. Use for initial notifications, significant status changes, and final resolution messages.                                                              |
| **Confluence / Internal Knowledge Base (Crisis Hub)** | **The centralized repository** for all detailed crisis-related information, FAQs, timelines, and archived communications. Direct employees here for comprehensive context and less urgent details.                                                          |
| **Virtual Town Halls / All-Hands Meetings** | **For live Q\&A, leadership involvement, and addressing sensitive topics** directly. Use for major, company-wide incidents requiring direct engagement or significant explanation.                                                                                        |
| **Manager Cascade (Verbal / Team Meetings)** | Managers receive key talking points and **disseminate information directly** to their teams, allowing for personalized context and immediate Q\&A within smaller groups.                                                                                             |

## Tips and Best Practices

  * **Be Timely, Not Necessarily Instant:** Focus on accuracy and a clear message over being the absolute first to respond. A slightly delayed but factual update is better than a quick, inaccurate one.
  * **Timestamp Every Update:** Clearly indicate the date and time for each message. This provides a clear timeline and context.
  * **Assign a Single Point of Contact (POC):** For each communication or campaign, ensure one person is responsible for drafting and coordinating approvals to maintain a consistent voice.
  * **Update Regularly, Even Without Progress:** If there's no new information, state that the team is still working on it and provide the next expected update time. Silence causes speculation.
  * **Avoid Jargon and Acronyms:** Use plain language that all employees can understand, regardless of their technical background. Define any necessary technical terms.
  * **Be Empathetic and Reassuring:** Acknowledge the impact of the crisis on employees where appropriate, without sugarcoating the situation.
  * **Archive All Communications:** Store all crisis messages in a central, accessible location (like the Confluence crisis hub) for compliance, post-crisis analysis, and future reference.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem                                  | Suggested Fix                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| :--------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Mixed messages from different teams/individuals** | Reinforce the role of the **Crisis Lead** as the single source of truth for official internal communications. All messages must be approved by the Crisis Lead (and potentially Legal/HR) before dissemination. Provide quick templates for managers to use in their teams. |
| **Information overload or underload** | Stick to the 4-part message format (`What Happened`, `What Weâ€™re Doing`, `What You Should Do`, `Whatâ€™s Next`). For complex details, link to the Confluence crisis hub rather than putting everything in the email/chat. Balance frequent updates with meaningful content.           |
| **Miscommunication or persistent confusion** | Reiterate key updates via multiple channels (e.g., a short Slack reminder followed by a more detailed email). Open a dedicated, temporary Slack channel for general employee questions that can be answered by the Crisis Communications team or designated FAQs.                     |
| **Slow approval process for messages** | Pre-approve basic statement templates for common scenarios. Ensure all approvers are aware of their rapid response responsibilities during a crisis. Establish clear, streamlined approval workflows *before* a crisis.                                                             |
| **Difficulty gathering factual information** | Integrate closely with the incident response or technical leads. Ensure clear lines of communication between the technical teams resolving the issue and the communications team drafting messages. Define data points to collect in advance.                                  |
