## Troubleshooting

| Problem                   | Solution                                                  | Risk if Ignored                            |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Message feels generic     | Add specific updates, recognitions, and team mentions     | Decreased trust and skipped messages       |
| Low engagement            | A/B test subject lines, shorten length, time it better    | Strategic updates are missed               |
| Missed follow-ups/actions | Bold CTAs, tag responsible teams, link to resources       | Confusion and execution gaps               |
| Audience unclear on value | Lead with purpose and progress, provide narrative context | Update feels ceremonial rather than useful |
| Message perceived as spin | Address blockers honestly, avoid PR tone                  | Damaged credibility and disengagement      |
