Regular leadership updates build transparency, alignment, and trust across the organization. This template helps ensure consistency in tone, structure, and delivery for leadership communications.

## Purpose

Leadership updates help:
- Communicate progress on strategic goals
- Reinforce values, vision, and priorities
- Acknowledge key contributions and milestones
- Set tone and direction for the upcoming period

This template ensures updates are easy to read, clear in intent, and actionable where needed.

## Suggested Format

```
Subject: [Leadership Update] [Date or Timeframe]

1. Opening Message
   A brief and authentic message from the leader‚Äîcan include context, appreciation, or tone-setting.

2. Key Highlights
   - Bullet-point summary of 3‚Äì5 major updates, wins, or insights
   - Link to deeper content if needed (OKRs, dashboards, announcements)

3. Areas of Focus
   - What‚Äôs ahead for the team/org this week/month
   - Where alignment or support is needed

4. Notes or Acknowledgments

   - Thank yous or cultural shout-outs

5. Closing

```

## Writing Guidelines

- Be clear, not corporate. Use human-centered language.
- Avoid jargon, acronyms, or overly technical phrasing unless necessary.
- Keep sections concise and scannable‚Äîleaders are busy, and so are readers.
- Prioritize relevance to the audience. What do they need to know?
- If including numbers or metrics, explain what they mean or why they matter.
