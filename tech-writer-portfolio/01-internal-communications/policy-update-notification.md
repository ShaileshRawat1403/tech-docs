# Policy Update Notification

Use this template to announce new or revised internal policies. Clear and timely communication ensures employees are informed, understand required actions, and feel included in organizational changes.

## Overview

Policy updates often affect workflows, responsibilities, or compliance expectations. Communicating these changes effectively prevents confusion and supports adoption across teams.

## Why It Matters

Well-structured policy announcements:

- Provide transparency into organizational decision-making  
- Ensure timely compliance with legal, procedural, or operational updates  
- Clarify expectations and support employees in navigating change  
- Reduce back-and-forth questions by surfacing key information up front

- Confirm policy version has been reviewed and approved by stakeholders (e.g., Legal, HR, IT)  
- Update relevant links to documents, FAQs, and knowledge base articles  
- Prepare any required acknowledgment workflows (e.g., HRIS prompts, LMS confirmations)
