# Internal Newsletter Guide

> Create internal newsletters that are clear, relevant, and engaging—without overwhelming your teams.

---

## Overview

Internal newsletters are a key channel for transparent and consistent communication. When done well, they align teams, surface key updates, and reinforce a sense of connection.

---

## Why It Matters

A structured, scannable newsletter ensures that employees:

- Receive timely updates without overload  
- Understand what's important and what’s changing  
- Feel connected to organizational momentum  
- Know where to find more details or take action  

---

## Prerequisites

Before launching a recurring newsletter:

- Identify the target audience (all-staff, function, or project-based)  
- Decide frequency (monthly or biweekly is typical)  
- Choose a consistent distribution platform (email, Slack, Confluence)  
- Create a content calendar for planning and accountability

## Troubleshooting

| Problem                             | Solution                                                  |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Low engagement                     | Use clearer subject lines, feature stories, and scannable layout |
| Inconsistent publishing cadence     | Create a calendar and assign newsletter roles             |
| Overloaded content                 | Split across channels (e.g., urgent updates by Slack, details via newsletter) |
| Unclear ownership                  | Assign an editor-in-chief or managing sender              |
