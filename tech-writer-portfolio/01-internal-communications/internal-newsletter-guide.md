# Internal Newsletter Guide

> Create internal newsletters that are clear, relevant, and engaging—without overwhelming your teams.

---

## Purpose

Internal newsletters help teams stay aligned, informed, and connected. Use this guide to plan content that’s useful, scannable, and easy to act on.

---

## Recommended Structure

Each edition should follow a predictable format. Here's a simple template:

```
📰 **Newsletter Title or Theme**

**1. Key Updates**  
• [Short bullet on major news or changes]  
• [Launches, policy shifts, or org updates]

**2. Team Highlights**  
• [Recognitions, success stories, new joiners]

**3. Important Dates**  
• [Upcoming deadlines, events, or releases]

**4. Resources & Links**  
• [Link to documents, new tools, or training]

**5. Call to Action**  
• [Encourage feedback, questions, or next steps]

— [Sender’s Name / Team Name]
```

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do:

- Use plain, clear language.
- Keep it under 400 words.
- Link out for deeper content.
- Use consistent sections in each edition.

### ❌ Avoid:

- Long paragraphs without breaks.
- Too many hyperlinks or attachments.
- Mixing critical updates with casual content.

## Reusable Blocks

You can templatize sections using Confluence macros or GitHub snippets:

- `{{announcement}}`  
- `{{people-highlight}}`  
- `{{resource-link-block}}`

This saves time and ensures consistency across teams.
