# Communication Metrics Dashboard

> Measure what matters. Track internal communication health with clarity and consistency.

## Overview

This document helps internal teams define and track communication KPIs to evaluate engagement, visibility, and channel effectiveness.

---

## Why It Matters

Without clear metrics, it's hard to know whether communication efforts are working. A metrics dashboard enables teams to:
- Make informed decisions
- Identify trends and gaps
- Justify changes to leadership with data

---

## Prerequisites

Before building your dashboard:
- Define your communication goals
- Ensure you have access to tools like Slack, Outlook, Confluence, etc.
- Align metric definitions with stakeholders

### Build the Dashboard

Use a spreadsheet, Notion, or wiki page:

```
🗓️ Period: [Month / Quarter]
📊 Campaign: [Name or theme]

| Metric                  | Target | Actual | Notes                     |
|-------------------------|--------|--------|---------------------------|
| Email Open Rate         | 60%    | 52%    | Improve subject line      |
| Slack Engagement Rate   | 30%    | 40%    | Used visual element       |
| Survey Completion       | 70%    | 68%    | Follow-up survey needed   |
| Town Hall Attendance    | 85%    | 92%    | Sent reminders early      |
```

Color-code rows to show performance at a glance:
- ✅ Meets or exceeds target
- ⚠️ Slightly below target
- ❌ Needs immediate attention

### Visualize Data

Choose appropriate visual formats:
- Bar charts: Show time-based trends
- Heatmaps: Spot low-engagement areas
- Pie charts: Compare channel effectiveness
- Word clouds: Surface recurring feedback themes

Tools: Google Sheets, Tableau, Power BI
