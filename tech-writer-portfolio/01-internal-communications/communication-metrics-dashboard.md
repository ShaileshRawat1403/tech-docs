# Communication Metrics Dashboard

A structured guide to help internal communication teams design dashboards that don‚Äôt just track clicks‚Äîbut reveal clarity, engagement, and alignment.

---

## Overview

This guide outlines how to build and interpret a **Communication Metrics Dashboard** tailored for internal initiatives. While tools and teams vary, the objective remains the same: surface meaningful patterns to inform better communication strategy‚Äînot just count how many emails were opened.

Use this file to move beyond vanity metrics and focus on signal, not noise.

---

## Why It Matters

Internal communication often lacks visibility into whether messages are working. Traditional reporting focuses on opens, clicks, or delivery‚Äîbut fails to answer:

- Did people **understand** the message?
- Did they **act** on it?
- Did the message reach the **right** teams at the **right** time?

Without this clarity, communicators risk repeating ineffective formats, under-engaging stakeholders, or flooding inboxes with unread noise.

A communication metrics dashboard closes this gap by helping you:

- **Benchmark engagement and comprehension**
- **Spot underperforming channels or formats**
- **Adapt your messaging strategy across teams and campaigns**

---

## Audience and Scope

This guide is designed for:

- **Internal communication teams** creating quarterly or monthly dashboards
- **HR, IT, or Project Teams** leading change initiatives or campaigns that rely on internal comms
- **Executive sponsors or VPs** seeking insights on messaging effectiveness

It applies to digital communications via email, chat (Slack/Teams), intranet, and internal portals. It excludes public or customer-facing comms.

---

## Prerequisites

Before building or interpreting a dashboard:

- Define **specific communication goals** (e.g., awareness vs. action)
- Confirm which **channels** (email, Slack, Intranet) and tools (e.g., Outlook analytics, Google Workspace, Power BI) are available
- Align with leadership on **what success looks like** for each initiative
- Get access to basic analytics, survey data, or engagement feedback

## Instructions

Follow these core setup steps to build a meaningful dashboard:

### üß© Dashboard Structure Snippet

```markdown
## Communication Dashboard: [Quarter / Campaign Name]

| Message Title         | Channel   | Audience     | Open Rate | CTA Clicks | Feedback Score | Owner    |
|-----------------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|------------|----------------|----------|
| [Message name]        | [Email]   | [All Staff]  | [72%]     | [44%]      | [4.1 / 5]       | [Team]   |
| [Another message]     | [Slack]   | [Managers]   | [63%]     | [36%]      | [3.8 / 5]       | [Owner]  |
```

> Use this as your base. Add fields like ‚ÄúType of Message‚Äù or ‚ÄúSentiment‚Äù if needed. Make sure all columns reflect your initiative goals.

## Example: Dashboard Table

| Message Title | Channel | Audience | Open Rate | CTA Clicks | Feedback Score | Owner |
|---------------|---------|----------|-----------|------------|----------------|--------|
| New Expense Policy | Email | All Staff | 72% | 44% | 4.1 / 5 | HR Ops |
| LMS Migration | Slack + Intranet | Engineering | 63% | 36% | 3.8 / 5 | L&D |
| FYI: Org Realignment | Email | Managers | 91% | 12% | 4.6 / 5 | Exec Comms |

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Don‚Äôt track everything.** Focus on what helps improve strategy.
- **Mix quant + qual.** Combine numbers with insight.
- **Use consistent formatting.** Helps stakeholders scan and compare.
- **Don‚Äôt stop at open rates.** Always ask: What changed because of this message?
- **Present insights, not just data.** Add a ‚ÄúKey Takeaways‚Äù section to every dashboard.

### üõ† Copy-Paste: Key Insights Template

```markdown
## Key Takeaways ‚Äì [Month/Campaign]

- Most opened message: [Name] (91%)
- Lowest engagement: [Message] ‚Äì consider simplifying structure
- Trend: Slack posts had higher view rates than email for short updates
- Suggested improvement: Use stronger CTA phrasing in Q3 compliance reminders
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely Cause | Fix |
|--------|--------------|-----|
| Low open rates | Poor subject line, bad timing | Test send time and rewrite subject headers |
| High open, low action | Message not actionable or buried CTAs | Simplify body and bold calls to action |
| Good metrics, poor outcomes | Misaligned goal/KPIs | Revisit what you‚Äôre measuring vs. what you care about |
| Stakeholders don‚Äôt trust dashboard | No qualitative layer or overcomplicated charts | Add clear narratives, reduce clutter |

## Dependencies and Impact Areas

### üîó Dependencies

The successful implementation of this communication practice relies on:

- **Data Sources & Analytics Access**  
  Tools like Google Workspace insights, Outlook engagement stats, Slack analytics, or Intranet logs must be accessible and connected.
  
- **Content & Message Management Platforms**  
  Requires integration or exports from CMS platforms like Confluence, Notion, SharePoint, or internal knowledge bases.

- **Survey & Feedback Systems**  
  Platforms such as Google Forms, Typeform, or CultureAmp for collecting qualitative insights or follow-up feedback.

- **Approval Workflow Tools**  
  Systems like Jira, Trello, or documented Slack/email workflows for tracking content approval and stakeholder sign-off.

- **People Directory or Org Charts**  
  Updated access to team ownership data to map messages to audience clusters (e.g., L&D, Engineering, HR).
