# Feedback Collection Process: Capturing Insights During Change Initiatives

A structured process for designing, collecting, analyzing, and responding to feedback during internal changes‚Äîsupporting adoption, adaptation, and continuous improvement.

---

## Overview

This guide outlines a structured **Feedback Collection Process** tailored to internal organizational change efforts. From new systems to policy rollouts, collecting timely, focused, and actionable feedback helps teams understand how the change is experienced by employees, adjust strategy, and close the loop to build long-term trust.

---

## Why It Matters

Effective change isn‚Äôt imposed‚Äîit‚Äôs co-created. Feedback is the mechanism through which organizations sense resistance, validate direction, and show responsiveness. A structured feedback collection process helps:

- **Identify adoption barriers** before they scale.
- **Validate assumptions** behind the change with real experiences.
- **Drive continuous improvement** during and after rollout.
- **Mitigate resistance** by showing employees their voice matters.
- **Enhance usability** of tools, policies, or workflows.
- **Build transparency and trust** through visible action on input.

---

## Audience and Scope

This guide supports:

- **Change Management Leads** ‚Äì to embed agile listening into rollouts.
- **Project Managers** ‚Äì to use insights for mid-course adjustments.
- **Comms Teams** ‚Äì to promote participation and report results.
- **HR/People Ops** ‚Äì to understand emotional, cultural, and operational impact.
- **Trainers** ‚Äì to align learning with emerging user needs.
- **Team Leads/Managers** ‚Äì to advocate and localize collection efforts.

This is **not a general engagement survey** framework. It is scoped specifically for **change-specific employee feedback**.

---

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Clear understanding of the change initiative and its goals.
- [ ] Stakeholder map or impact matrix ([Readiness Assessment](./change-readiness-assessment.md)).
- [ ] Approved comms and collection channels (e.g. Forms, Slack).
- [ ] Named owner for collection, triage, and action routing.
- [ ] Defined process for prioritizing and implementing feedback.
- [ ] Privacy guidelines for anonymous/confidential feedback.

## Instructions

### 1. Define Feedback Objectives

Clarify what you want to learn.

```markdown
üéØ Objective:
"Identify key technical blockers in CRM system rollout (within 2 weeks)"
üéØ Objective:
"Measure comfort with new hybrid work policy after 30 days"
````

---

### 2. Select Sources and Channels

| Channel                   | Use Case                                           |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Targeted Surveys          | Quantify sentiment, pain points, awareness.        |
| Focus Groups              | Deep dives into group patterns and resistance.     |
| 1:1 Interviews            | Executive or high-impact voices.                   |
| Feedback Forms (Intranet) | Always-on suggestion intake.                       |
| Helpdesk Data             | Spot issue trends via support tickets.             |
| Team Retrospectives       | Add change prompts to agile reviews.               |
| Slack/Teams Channels      | Live Q\&A and informal friction capture.           |
| Gemba Walks               | Observe systems/processes being used in real-time. |

---

### 3. Time Your Collection

| Phase               | Goal                            | Method                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Pre-Launch          | Readiness & awareness           | Pulse survey, 1:1 interviews         |
| Pilot               | Usability, early blockers       | Slack, daily check-ins, observation  |
| Initial Rollout     | Adoption + recurring issues     | Quick forms, helpdesk, live feedback |
| Post-Implementation | Long-term outcomes, suggestions | Survey + focus groups                |

---

### 4. Build the Tools

* Use **Likert scale** + open-text questions.
* Use **themes or tags**: UX, comms, clarity, resistance.
* Pilot your survey with 5‚Äì10 users before mass rollout.

---

### 5. Promote the Channels

* Add feedback links in every update.
* Pin forms in Slack, Confluence.
* Ask team leads to prompt direct reports.

---

### 6. Collect and Consolidate

* Centralize data in a shared board (Notion, Trello, Airtable).
* Use themes + urgency labels.
* Track timestamp, team, sentiment.

---

### 7. Analyze and Prioritize

```markdown
üóÇ Theme: "Training Gaps"
üí¨ Excerpt: "I wasn‚Äôt clear on which form to submit for WFH requests."
üî• Urgency: High
üéØ Owner: T&D team
```

Use visual dashboards ([Communication Metrics Dashboard](../01-internal-communications/communication-metrics-dashboard.md)) to summarize.

---

### 8. Act and Close the Loop

* Route issues to relevant teams.
* Share "What We Heard" + "What We Did."
* Track follow-up completion rate and satisfaction change.

---

## Examples and Templates

### ‚úÖ Feedback Digest Template

```markdown
Subject: Feedback Summary ‚Äì Week 3 (CRM Rollout)

Hi team,

üéØ Top Themes:
- 46% found navigation unclear
- 22% suggested mobile view issues

‚úÖ Actions Taken:
- UI team adjusted menu structure
- Mobile fix deployed in v1.2.1

Keep sharing feedback here: [Form Link]

‚Äî Change Team
```

### ‚úÖ vs ‚ùå Asking for Feedback

| ‚ùå Don‚Äôt Ask          | ‚úÖ Ask Instead                                               | Why It Matters                      |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| "What do you think?" | "What was the hardest part of submitting a request?"        | Actionable insight over vague input |
| "Any issues?"        | "Rate your ease of use (1‚Äì5) + add any blocker you faced"   | Encourages both metrics and story   |
| "Your input matters" | "We heard you on \[X]‚Äîhere‚Äôs what changed \[Y]. Thank you." | Builds trust through follow-up      |

---

## Tips

* Use anonymous forms for sensitive input.
* Avoid collecting too often‚Äîcoordinate across teams.
* Share insights visually when possible.
* Celebrate improvements that came from feedback.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                       | Suggested Fix                                  | Risk if Ignored                   |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Low response rate           | Clarify use, promise anonymity, promote widely | Blind spots, misalignment         |
| Vague feedback              | Use specific, scoped prompts                   | Unusable insights, frustration    |
| Feedback not acted upon     | Assign owners, publish status updates          | Trust erosion, future silence     |
| Too much raw data           | Tag + prioritize by frequency/impact           | Analysis paralysis, delayed fixes |
| Sensitive concerns withheld | Offer anonymous channels, manager proxies      | Unspoken blockers, hidden risk    |
