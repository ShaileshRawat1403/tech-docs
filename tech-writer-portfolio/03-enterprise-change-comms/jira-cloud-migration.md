## Instructions

Follow these steps to navigate the Jira Cloud migration successfully and begin working in the new environment.

### 1. Understand the Migration Timeline

Familiarize yourself with the key phases and dates of the migration. Your project teams will be notified of specific blackout windows that affect them directly.

* **Phase 1: Pre-Migration Data Cleanup (Current - [Date X])**
    * Review and clean up your Jira data as per guidelines.
    * Attend mandatory user training sessions and demos.
* **Phase 2: Migration Blackout Window ([Date Y] - [Date Z])**
    * Jira Server/Data Center will be read-only or completely inaccessible during this period.
    * No new issues, comments, or updates can be made.
    * **Critical:** Save all in-progress work outside Jira before this window begins.
* **Phase 3: Jira Cloud Go-Live ([Date A])**
    * You will receive a "Go-Live" notification and gain access to the new Jira Cloud instance.
    * All your existing projects, issues, and data will be available in the new environment.

### 2. Prepare for User Interface & Feature Changes

The Jira Cloud interface features a more modern design and introduces new functionalities. Review these key changes to minimize post-migration friction.

* **Navigation:** The main navigation bar, project sidebar, and individual issue view layout will have a refreshed look. Expect a more streamlined left-hand navigation.
* **Automation:** Enhanced no-code automation features (Jira Automation) will largely replace many legacy server-side scripts. Familiarize yourself with the new visual builder.
* **Search & Filters:** The advanced search (JQL) functionality remains consistent, but the basic search and filter creation might have minor UI adjustments.
* **Boards:** Kanban and Scrum boards will have a slightly different look and feel, but their core functionality for agile project management remains similar.
* **Integrations:** Some existing integrations with other tools (e.g., Confluence, Slack, GitHub) may require re-authentication or re-setup with the new cloud instance.

### 3. Access Jira Cloud Post-Migration

Once the migration is complete and you receive the "Go-Live" notification, follow these steps to log in to the new environment:

1.  **Clear Browser Cache:** Clear your browser's cache and cookies to prevent any lingering references to the old Jira Server instance. This is a common first troubleshooting step.
2.  **Access New URL:** Navigate directly to the new Jira Cloud URL: `https://yourcompany.atlassian.net/` (confirm the specific URL in the official go-live announcement).
3.  **Log In:** Use your corporate email address associated with your Atlassian account. You will likely be redirected to our Single Sign-On (SSO) provider for authentication.
4.  **Verify Access:** Confirm you can see your dashboards, favorite projects, and recent issues.

### 4. Perform Post-Migration Verification

After successfully gaining access, quickly verify your critical data and workflows to ensure a smooth continuation of work.

1.  **Check Key Projects:** Ensure all your primary projects are visible and accessible.
2.  **Review Dashboards:** Verify that your customized dashboards and gadgets are displaying correctly and accurately.
3.  **Validate Filters:** Check your saved filters to ensure they still return the expected results for your issues.
4.  **Open Recent Issues:** Confirm you can access, view details, and comment on issues you recently worked on.
5.  **Test a Common Workflow:** Go through a typical workflow that is essential to your role (e.g., creating a new issue, moving an issue through a status, adding a comment or attachment).

### 5. Utilize Support Channels

If you encounter any issues post-migration, use the designated support channels for rapid assistance.

* **Migration Support Channel:** For immediate, high-priority issues or questions specific to the migration, use the dedicated Slack/Teams channel: `#jira-cloud-migration-support`.
* **Jira Help Desk:** For general questions, non-critical issues, or feature requests once the migration is stable, create a ticket in the Jira Service Management portal: `[Link to Jira Service Management Portal]`.
* **Training Resources:** Refer to the updated training materials and FAQs on our internal Confluence space for common how-to questions and self-service solutions.
