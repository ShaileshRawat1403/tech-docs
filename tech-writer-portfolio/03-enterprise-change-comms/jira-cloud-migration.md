# Jira Cloud Migration: A Guide for Teams

A guide for all users on the upcoming migration of our Jira instances to Atlassian Cloud, covering timelines, user impact, and essential next steps for a smooth transition.

---

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive information on the upcoming **Jira Cloud Migration**, detailing our transition from Jira Server (or Data Center) to **Atlassian Cloud**. This strategic shift enhances project tracking, collaboration, and automation through a modern, scalable platform.

You’ll find key timelines, user responsibilities, post-migration steps, and support resources here—so you can continue your work with minimal friction and maximum clarity.

---

## Why It Matters

Migrating to Jira Cloud impacts how teams track work, collaborate, and interact with project data. Done well, it unlocks:

- **Scalability & Speed:** Jira Cloud runs on Atlassian infrastructure with faster response times and reliability.
- **Remote Access:** Work from anywhere, any time, without VPN dependency.
- **Continuous Updates:** Enjoy the latest features, security patches, and integrations—automatically.
- **Reduced IT Overhead:** Infrastructure management shifts to Atlassian.
- **Security & Compliance:** Built-in controls and certifications improve risk posture.
- **Modern Workflows:** Visual automation and streamlined dashboards make processes easier to manage.

This is not just a platform change—it’s a foundational shift in how we manage work at scale.

---

## Audience and Scope

**Intended Users:**

- All Jira users: engineers, PMs, QA, business analysts, support, and more.
- Jira admins and project leads.
- Teams integrating Jira into larger workflows (e.g., with Confluence, GitHub, Slack).

**Scope:**

This document addresses **user-facing impacts** of the migration: interface updates, access instructions, data verification, support.  
Backend technical migration tasks (e.g., system mapping, backend scripts) are handled by the **Jira Migration Team**.

---

## Prerequisites

Before the migration window begins:

- [ ] Review internal email communications and Confluence updates.
- [ ] Attend scheduled demo sessions or watch the recorded training walkthrough.
- [ ] Clean up inactive or outdated issues, filters, dashboards.
- [ ] Save any unsaved draft comments or pending work to a local file.
- [ ] Confirm your Atlassian account (corporate email-based) is active.

## Tasks

### 1. Understand the Migration Timeline

| Phase                     | Date Range       | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Pre-Migration Cleanup**| Now → [Date X]   | Clean your Jira workspace. Attend training. Prepare team.                  |
| **Migration Blackout**   | [Date Y] → [Date Z]| Jira will be read-only or offline. No edits or comments possible.         |
| **Go-Live**              | [Date A]         | New Cloud URL live. Login begins. Post-migration checks required.          |

---

### 2. Log In to Jira Cloud

After Go-Live, follow this:

1. Clear browser cache and cookies.
2. Visit: `https://yourcompany.atlassian.net/`
3. Use your corporate email to sign in via SSO.
4. Verify dashboards, boards, and filters are intact.

| Integrations        | Manual setups                     | May require re-authentication or app reinstallation                |

---

### 4. Verify Post-Migration Access

- Confirm project visibility and access.
- Check dashboards and gadgets.
- Open recent issues—validate data and comments.
- Test a full workflow: Create → Assign → Comment → Transition → Close.

### ✅ vs ❌ Jira Cloud Habits

| ❌ Old Practice                      | ✅ Cloud-Optimized Habit                                             |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Manually updating issues daily      | Use **Jira Automation** rules to update statuses, assign tasks      |
| Saving browser bookmarks to old URL | Update bookmarks to the new Jira Cloud URL                          |
| Ignoring gadget migration issues    | Rebuild dashboards using updated gadgets for better compatibility   |
| Skipping browser refresh            | Always clear cache before accessing the new instance post-migration |

---

## Tips

* Bookmark the Jira Cloud login URL.
* Record a screencast of your typical Jira flow and compare it after migration.
* Look into Jira Cloud mobile apps for work on the go.
* Use filters like `assignee = currentUser()` to quickly regain familiar views.
* Use Atlassian’s public docs to explore new automation and dashboard features.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem                          | Resolution                                                             | Risk if Ignored                  |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |

| Project missing                  | Confirm permissions. Share project key with support team.              | Loss of work continuity          |
| Filters or dashboards broken     | Rebuild in Cloud. Learn new gadgets and visual filters.                | Reporting breakdowns             |
| Automation failure               | Use the new **visual automation builder** to recreate essential rules. | Manual overhead, delays          |
| UI feels unfamiliar              | Refer to Jira Cloud training videos. Use guided walkthroughs.          | Reduced productivity             |
| Integration broken (Slack, etc.) | Re-authenticate or re-install app in Jira Cloud. Follow IT guide.      | Loss of team visibility and sync |

## Dependencies and Impact Areas

### Dependencies

The successful implementation of an org-wide policy change depends on coordination across multiple roles and systems:

| Role/Team                | Responsibility                                                                 |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Policy Owners**        | Drafting, legal validation, and final approval of the policy document          |
| **IT & Infrastructure**  | Updating access controls, internal systems, and document distribution platforms |
| **Internal Communications** | Crafting, scheduling, and sending communications across multiple channels    |
| **Training & Development (L&D)** | Developing training content, walkthroughs, and onboarding modules     |
| **HR & People Ops**      | Managing employee acknowledgments, system records, and escalations             |
