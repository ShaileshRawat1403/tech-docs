### ❌ vs ✅ Examples

| ❌ Weak Framing                         | ✅ Strong Framing                              | Why It Matters                        |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| “Things are progressing well overall.” | “Phase 1 is 80% complete; we’re on track.”    | Specificity builds confidence.        |
| “There are some issues.”               | “Legacy decommissioning may delay Phase 2.”   | Clear risk = better decisions.        |
| “Need more people soon.”               | “Request 2 FTEs by July 10 to stay on track.” | Drives timely and actionable support. |

## Tips and Best Practices

* **Lead with the Ask**: Don’t bury decisions in the middle.
* **Use Real Metrics**: Time saved, money at risk, % completed.
* **Respect Time**: The summary must be skimmable in under 15 seconds.
* **Link, Don’t Dump**: Offload detail to docs, not the main brief.
* **Anticipate Executive Questions**: Be prepared to defend your recommendation briefly and confidently.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                           | Resolution                                                | Impact if Ignored                          |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Leaders unclear on decision ask | Start with the ask. Use bold formatting. Repeat near end. | Missed approvals, delays, decision fatigue |
| Too detailed                    | Stick to max 5 bullets/section. Shift detail to appendix. | Executive disengagement, credibility loss  |
| Challenge stated, no solution   | Always pair a challenge with a mitigation or request.     | Frustration, risk of indecision            |
| Stakeholders not aligned        | Pre-brief key teams or exec aides to reduce surprises.    | Conflicts in meeting, loss of trust        |
| Mixed tone or passive voice     | Use direct, active voice. Review with style guide.        | Reduces clarity and leadership confidence  |
