## Assessment Scorecard Template

Use this scorecard to log readiness levels across teams and dimensions.

```markdown
## Readiness Assessment – Team Scorecard

| Readiness Dimension         | Team/Group           | Readiness Rating | Supporting Notes                                                              |
|----------------------------|----------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Awareness & Understanding  | Sales                | Medium (65%)     | Some confusion on rollout date and affected tools                            |
| Leadership Sponsorship     | Product Leadership   | High (85%)       | Consistent weekly updates in leadership syncs                                |
| Capacity & Resources       | Customer Success     | Low (40%)        | No backup coverage for training time; bandwidth overload flagged             |
| Willingness & Motivation   | HR                   | Medium (60%)     | High willingness, but unclear on what's expected post-launch                 |
| Cultural Alignment         | Engineering          | High (90%)       | Team used to agile rollouts; positive sentiment observed                     |
| Past Change Experience     | Operations           | Low (35%)        | Negative history with ERP migration; team skeptical about promises made      |

## Survey Prompt Framing (❌ vs ✅)

Designing clear, non-leading survey questions improves the quality of your insights.

| ❌ Avoid (Biased or Vague)                | ✅ Use (Clear and Neutral)                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Do you feel excited about the change?"  | "How prepared do you feel for the upcoming change? (1 = Not at all, 5 = Very prepared)"     |
| "Do you trust leadership on this?"       | "To what extent do you feel leadership is aligned on the goals of this change? (1-5 scale)" |
| "Have you heard the change is coming?"   | "What is your current level of awareness about the \[Change Name] initiative?"              |
| "Will this change make your job easier?" | "What aspects of your daily work will be impacted by this change? (Open-ended)"             |

## Change Readiness Action Planning Snippet

Use this format to create team-specific intervention plans based on identified readiness gaps.

```markdown
📍 Team/Group: [e.g., Support Operations]
📉 Readiness Rating: [e.g., Low – 35%]
🧭 Key Gaps:
- Lack of awareness about rollout dates
- Negative experience with previous tool migrations
🛠 Recommended Actions:
- Custom onboarding session led by product lead
- Slack Q&A channel for early questions
- Anonymous survey to capture specific fears
👤 Owner: [e.g., Change Lead – Region X]
📅 Deadline: [e.g., July 15]
```

```markdown
### Readiness Interview Questions

2. How do you think this change will impact your team or daily work?
3. Do you feel you’ll receive adequate training or support?
4. What past experiences with change have influenced how you feel about this one?
5. What would make this change easier to accept or adopt?
6. Are there any blockers or concerns you’d like us to flag to leadership?
```

## Slack or Email Check-in Template

```markdown
