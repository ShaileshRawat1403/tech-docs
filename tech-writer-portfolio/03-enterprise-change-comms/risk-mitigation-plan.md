# Risk Mitigation Plan: Anticipation and Communication During Change

This guide outlines a repeatable approach for identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks associated with organizational change. It helps cross-functional teams communicate potential threats early, implement mitigation actions, and align stakeholders on accountability and response.

---

## Overview

In any enterprise-wide change initiative, risks are inevitable. From system delays to cultural resistance, unmanaged risks can lead to poor adoption, operational disruption, or reputational harm. This guide supports internal comms, change leads, and project managers in building a reliable, shareable risk mitigation plan that is easy to update, distribute, and track.

---

## Why It Matters

Unspoken risks become blockers. Untracked risks become failures.

A risk mitigation plan:

- Proactively identifies threats before they escalate  
- Encourages transparent communication across silos  
- Aligns teams on ownership and mitigation efforts  
- Builds leadership trust through preparedness  
- Increases change success rates by reducing last-minute surprises  

---

## Audience and Scope

This document is intended for:

- Change Managers and Program Owners  
- Project Leads and PMO Teams  
- Internal Communications and Stakeholder Engagement Teams  
- Department Heads involved in change execution  

Scope includes:

- Identifying, documenting, and monitoring internal risks related to a change program (people, process, tech, legal, timing)
- Communicating mitigation steps and responsible owners

Excluded:

- Legal-only risk assessments, investor risk disclosures, or insurance frameworks

---

## Prerequisites

Before creating your mitigation plan:

- Conduct a change impact assessment  
- Align with leadership on risk appetite and tolerance  
- Ensure stakeholder mapping is complete  
- Assign risk owners by domain (IT, HR, Comms, etc.)  
- Set up a shared document or dashboard to track plan evolution  

---

## Instructions

### 1. Identify and Categorize Risks

- Gather input from impacted teams via interviews or workshops  
- Classify risks by type: technical, operational, reputational, compliance, etc.  
- Rate risks based on **likelihood** and **impact**  
- Ensure risks are understandable by both technical and non-technical stakeholders  

### 2. Draft Mitigation Actions

- Define steps to reduce the chance or severity of each risk  
- Assign a clear owner and due date  
- Note any cross-team dependencies or escalation points  
- Provide fallback options if mitigation fails  

### 3. Communicate and Update the Plan

- Share the risk matrix and mitigation plan with relevant leads  
- Add it to the change comms dashboard or briefing cadence  
- Review weekly or bi-weekly based on initiative complexity  
- Use visual indicators to flag high-severity risks  
- Archive resolved risks with learnings to improve future planning

| Risk Description                     | Category     | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy                          | Owner        | Status   |
|-------------------------------------|--------------|------------|--------|----------------------------------------------|--------------|----------|
| Key system offline during rollout   | Technical    | High       | High   | Conduct full pre-launch simulation + backup  | IT Lead      | Active   |
| Low engagement from team leads      | Operational  | Medium     | High   | Host briefing, assign cascade responsibility | Comms Manager| Planned  |
| Legal ambiguity in new policy       | Compliance   | Low        | High   | Review with Legal + external counsel         | Legal Team   | Resolved |

### Risk Summary for Executive Briefings

```markdown
**Top Risk This Week:**  
Low completion rate for mandatory training (only 42% by cutoff date).  
üìç **Impact:** Could delay rollout and trigger compliance penalties.  
‚úÖ **Mitigation:** Extend deadline, send manager reminders, add calendar block.  
üßë‚Äçüíº **Owner:** L&D / Internal Comms  
```

## Tips and Best Practices

‚úÖ Do:

* Include risks in every change-related meeting
* Use a shared doc with filters or tags for severity
* Update mitigation statuses frequently
* Use color or emoji indicators in dashboards

‚ùå Don‚Äôt:

* Assume known risks are understood by others
* Leave mitigation actions vague or unassigned
* Hide risks to avoid leadership scrutiny
* Let the plan go stale after kickoff

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                       | Suggested Solution                                    | Risk if Ignored                      |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Risks not updated regularly | Assign plan owner, set bi-weekly reviews              | Outdated plan, poor decision-making  |
| Mitigation unclear          | Add bullets or links with specific tasks and fallback | Rework, misalignment                 |
| Owner missing or misaligned | Reconfirm owner by area (Comms, IT, Legal, etc.)      | Risk goes unhandled                  |
| High-risk areas downplayed  | Use objective impact scores and executive summaries   | Executive surprise, credibility loss |

## Dependencies and Impact Areas

### Dependencies

| Role/Team                   | Responsibility                                                   |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Change Leads / PMO**      | Maintain the risk log, host reviews, ensure plan visibility      |
| **Internal Comms**          | Communicate risk status in updates, escalate high-priority risks |
| **Functional Owners**       | Identify area-specific risks, own mitigation steps               |
| **IT, Legal, HR, Security** | Validate domain-specific mitigation plans                        |
| **Analytics / Reporting**   | Track risk trendlines and mitigation effectiveness               |
