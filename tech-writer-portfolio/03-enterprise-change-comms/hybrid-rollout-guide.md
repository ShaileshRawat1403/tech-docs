# Hybrid Rollout Guide

## Overview
This guide provides an approach for rolling out new software or services using a hybrid model, where a subset of users adopts the changes before the full organization does. The strategy helps reduce risk and gather feedback from early adopters.

## Audience
Project managers, IT administrators, and support teams responsible for deploying new solutions across multiple departments or regions.

## Objective
Describe how to plan and execute a phased deployment with minimal disruption. The guide explains how to select pilot groups, set success criteria, and scale gradually based on user feedback.

## Usage Scenarios
Use this approach when launching major upgrades or when migrating to a new platform that requires careful monitoring. A hybrid rollout is also useful for training purposes, allowing teams to document best practices while adoption expands.

## Best Practices
Communicate clearly with pilot groups so they know how to report issues. Maintain parallel systems during the trial phase to allow rollback if critical problems arise. Measure key metrics to gauge adoption and user satisfaction.

## Action Steps
1. Identify candidate teams or regions for the initial rollout.
2. Provide training materials and support channels for the pilot users.
3. Collect feedback and evaluate success metrics.
4. Address issues promptly and update documentation.
5. Expand the rollout to additional groups once initial targets confirm stability.
6. Conduct a final review and announce full deployment.
