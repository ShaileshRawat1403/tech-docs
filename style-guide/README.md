# Documentation Style Guide  
*Why structure, tone, and clarity matter across every document in this repository*

---

## Overview

This style guide outlines the consistent structure, tone, formatting rules, and content philosophy used across this documentation repository. It blends enterprise-grade standards (Google Developer Docs, Microsoft Style Guide) with a personal voice that aims to be clear, confident, and respectfully human. Each document in this repo ‚Äî whether focused on internal communications, AI, change management, or technical writing ‚Äî follows this style guide to offer a repeatable, thoughtful experience to readers.

---

## Why This Style Guide Exists

Most documentation fails not because of content, but because of **misalignment with readers' needs**. This repo exists to:

- Help technical and non-technical readers **understand and apply documentation concepts**
- Showcase writing systems across different documentation types (internal comms, API docs, change enablement)
- Demonstrate best practices while subtly reflecting the creator‚Äôs philosophy and usability-first mindset

Instead of overloading users with detail or corporate stiffness, this style guide promotes a **calm, clean, and approachable structure**.

## Structural Template for Every Markdown File

Each `.md` file in this repo follows this repeatable template, designed for GitHub rendering, GitHub Pages, MkDocs, and other doc platforms.

### ‚úÖ Front Matter Block

```yaml

title: [Title of the Page]
description: [Short summary for humans and search]

status: [draft | stable | deprecated]
version: [e.g., 1.0, optional]

## Overview
A short summary of what the file contains, who it's for, and the purpose.

## Why It Matters
Explain the stakes. Why this topic needs attention. Keep it relevant and benefit-driven.

## Prerequisites
Checklist of knowledge, approvals, setup, or context needed before diving in.

---

## Tasks / Instructions
Use clear headings, bullets, and sub-sections for readability.

* Prefer bullets over numbers unless order matters
* Use ‚úÖ vs ‚ùå examples to illustrate good/bad practice
* Include `code`, `email`, or `template` blocks only when useful

## Tone & Voice Guidelines

Our documentation avoids fluff, but also avoids cold robotic tone. We aim to **guide**, not instruct. Every file reflects these traits:

| Principle | How We Apply It | What We Avoid |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Human-Centered** | Speaks to the user respectfully | Talking down or assuming knowledge |
| **Second Person Voice** | "You will..." instead of "The user will..." | Third-person detachment |
| **Active Voice** | "Review the document" | "The document should be reviewed" |
| **Minimal Jargon** | Explains terms when used | Acronyms or tech speak without context |
| **Subtle Personality** | Taglines, examples, analogies where useful | Over-casual tone, too many emojis |

We want our documentation to feel *designed*, not dumped.

---

## Markdown Conventions

| Element | Practice |
|--------|----------|
| **Headings** | Use ATX-style `##`, not underlines |
| **Lists** | Use `*` bullets unless a process requires ordering |
| **Line Spacing** | Leave a line between sections and bullets |
| **Tables** | Use for troubleshooting, comparisons, or checklists |
| **Emojis** | Only where they serve an intentional purpose (‚úÖ, ‚ùå, ‚ö†Ô∏è) |
| **Breaks** | Use `---` to split sections cleanly |
| **Code/Quote Blocks** | Only use fenced blocks where output or templates are required |

---

## Folder & File Naming Standards

- Use lowercase-hyphen-case for filenames (`email-announcement-template.md`)
- `README.md` in every folder explains the folder's purpose
- Name files based on **function**, not tool (e.g., `incident-reporting.md`, not `form-xyz.md`)
- Do not use spaces, caps, or abbreviations in filenames

---

## Publishing Goals

This style guide supports documentation that can be:

- üìò Read directly on GitHub
- üåê Rendered via MkDocs or GitHub Pages
- üß± Modular and linkable in Confluence or other knowledge platforms
- üéØ Shared as part of a writer‚Äôs professional portfolio

---

## Final Thoughts

We write for clarity, for confidence, and for care. Every document should earn the reader‚Äôs time. And when it does, it leaves them better equipped ‚Äî not just better informed.
